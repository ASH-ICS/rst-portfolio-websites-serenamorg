<h3>October Weeks</h3>
<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-gold-watch-discontinued-repair"</a>
  
<p>In 2015, Apple introduced the Gold Apple Watch Edition, priced between $10,000 and $17,000. This shiny timepiece targeted an audience who wanted high-end fashion and a wrist piece's functionality. However, it had a short-lived shelf time because Apple discontinued it after a year. Apple decided to opt for more affordable versions of the Watch. </p>

	<p>On September 30, 2023, the Gold Apple Watch was added to the list of "obsolete" products from Apple. Apple products are considered obsolete if they stopped selling it 7 years ago. Apple's official list of obsolete products includes the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2, which they stopped selling over 5 years ago. Since the Gold Edition was added, it suggests possible challenges in getting support and repair services for the Gold Apple Watch Edition. The Gold Edition of the watch was also one of the first versions of the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Apple put the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition on the list of obsolete products, and that may make it harder for consumers, who purchased the product in 2015, for the 1 year it was available for purchase, to get support or repairs for such an expensive watch.</p>
